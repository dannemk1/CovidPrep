## Analyzing Coronavirus Evolution in Denmark and the United States: A Comparative Study of a Socialized Democratic and a Capitalistic Society
The coronavirus pandemic has affected everyone on the planet, no matter where you are or what you believe in. It has become clear that recovering from this disaster is dependent on preparedness, and ability to respond. How did the infectious disease spread in certain countries differently, and are there lessons that different societies can learn from each other to prevent such widespread catastrophe in the future? Static data highlighting economic, governmental and societal differences between Denmark and the United States are compiled from the World Bank Databank and cleaned for simple quantitative comparison. Weekly coronavirus case percentages and death rates from the Johns Hopkins Dashboard are analyzed using descriptive time series analysis, segmented simple linear regression, and statistical hypothesis testing to explore the differing coronavirus evolution of each country. While deaths rate remained similar from country to country in all phases of the pandemic, significantly higher case percentages were discovered in the United States the later phases. This leads me to believe coronavirus response policy is incredibly different from country to country and creates large discrepancies in all conversations of global recovery in the near future.

### Data
Original data files that are read into the CoronavirusAnalysis.ipynb file can be found in the DataExtracts folder. To summarize, there are 7 files in which the reader will find information on the topic mentioned in the file name for both countries. The Education Statistics, Global Economic Monitor, Health Nutritioin and Population Statistics, Poverty and Equity, World Development Indicators and Worldwide Governance Indicators tables are pulled from the World Bank Group Data Bank. The European CDC Daily Cases table was pulled from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Tracking Dashboard via the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 


### Methods 
All code can be found in the CoronavirusAnalysis.ipynb file. Here, you will find data cleaning and wrangling, followed by my four part analysis consisting of Distribution Analysis, Descriptive Time Series, Segmented Simple Linear Regression, and Statistical Hypothesis Testing.
